# nlu_core

This module contains "core" code for our agent-based full-path NLU system. 
The core code is all located in src/main/nluas, and the setup/config files
are located in the top directory.   

"Agents", in our system, are capable of building, sending, receiving, and 
using n-tuples, a custom communication tool.  An n-tuple contains action protocols
and application-specific content.    
  
Application Engineers wishing to use the "core" code for providing a NLU-interface
to their application can add their code to the "main" directory, importing the 
code from the "nluas" directory. A basic configuration requires at least:

* AgentUI: Communicates with the user. Analyzes text into a SemSpec, and specializes
this into an "n-tuple".

* ProblemSolver: Receives an n-tuple from the AgentUI, which it uses to solve a problem
in the application domain (e.g., robotics).
